## GOJO-CLI
A simple cli-based book tracker app where you can add and move your book accordingly. 
There are 3 sections : 
1. Yet to Read
2. Currently Reading
3. Completed Reading

The styling inside Terminal is done using BubbleTea and LipGloss from CharmCLI

### Future Plans
- want to store the books in csv file and extract from there
- add more formfields like genre, pages etc
